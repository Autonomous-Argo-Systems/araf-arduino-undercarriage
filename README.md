![Neorover](Neorover.jpg)
This code is a rosnode that is made to interface with ros to control the neorover.

## purpose
This is the first EXPERIMENTAL setup of the neorover to control it with ros. 
It uses a lot of wires and is a bit messy but works most of the time. 
It is experimental for a reason so do not use it on the new boards.
