## araf-arduino-onderstel
This code is a rosnode that is made to interface with ros to control the neorover.\
<img src="Neorover.jpg"  width="300" height="250">

## purpose
This is the first EXPERIMENTAL setup of the neorover to control it with ros. 
It uses a lot of wires and is a bit messy but works most of the time.\
It is experimental for a reason so do not use it on the new boards.

## setup

## flash
It is recommended to use the platformio extension for VS-Code to build an compile the code for an arduino nano.\
Please follow this tutorial: [Install PlatformIO Guide](https://platformio.org/install)
